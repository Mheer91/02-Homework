# 02-Homework: Student Portfolio


**UPDATE 1: ADDED FIRST PROJECT ON 8/1/21 AND UPDATED SCREENSHOT"


This assignment was for us to make a personal portofolio that could house all of our contact information and projects. I wanted a more basic layout so I found some colors that worked together and stuck to them for the entire page. I gave each item a slight shadow to make it appear as if it were hovering over the page. When you hover over one of the projects the shadow will grow and bolden, almost as if it were popping off the page even more. I plan to improve on this over time as I learn more in class.
